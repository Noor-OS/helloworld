Hello World OS example. It uses GRUB as bootloader and has only C file which is meant to be the kernel of our OS

to run build it on your own, you need linux or WSL on windows..

run build.sh file or run the commands on hand yourself.

you can either install virtualbox on your machine or use qemu to test the OS.

Good luck to everyone!
